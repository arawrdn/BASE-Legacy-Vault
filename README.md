# BASE Legacy Vault

BASE Legacy Vault is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Base Layer 2 network. It is designed to provide a secure, immutable, and permanent repository for digital legacies and historical documentation, ensuring that vital records are preserved for future generations using Ethereum's security and Base's scalability.

## Key Features

* **Immutable Legacy Storage:** Utilize Solidity smart contracts to anchor legacy data on the Base network.
* **Low-Cost Transactions:** Optimized for Base L2 to ensure high-speed and cost-effective data interaction.
* **Decentralized Governance:** Integrated voting system to validate and curate legacy entries.
* **ERC-5192 Implementation:** Support for Soulbound Tokens (SBT) to represent non-transferable achievement or contribution badges.
* **Web3 Connectivity:** Native support for EVM-compatible wallets and WalletConnect.

## Tech Stack

* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (EVM)
* **Development Framework:** Hardhat / Foundry
* **Network:** Base (Mainnet/Sepolia)
* **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js
* **Wallet Integration:** Wagmi, Viem, and WalletConnect v2
* **Storage:** IPFS / Arweave

## Prerequisites

To interact with this project, ensure you have:
* Node.js (v18.x or later)
* An Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
* Base Sepolia ETH (for testing) or Base Mainnet ETH (for production)
